# SDC_Lane_Finidng
Implemented a Lane detection for Self driving car using OpenCV.
For this I have used Canny Edge Detector for detecting edges and probablistic hough transformation for detecting stratight lines in the edges for finding the lane 
on the highway.
Also investigated complexities of other edge detectors like Sobel, Perwitt, Marr-Hildreth against Canny edge detector.


Given below are the outputs of the results of lane detection.
